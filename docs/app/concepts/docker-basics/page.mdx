# Understanding Docker in 10 Minutes

Docker is the reason self-hosting went from "sysadmin hobby" to "anyone can do it." It packages software into neat, isolated containers that run the same everywhere.

You don't need to become a Docker expert. You need to understand **four concepts**.

## Concept 1: Images

An **image** is a snapshot of software — pre-built, pre-configured, ready to run. Think of it like an `.iso` file, but for apps.

```bash
# Download the Plausible Analytics image
docker pull plausible/analytics:latest
```

Images live on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) — a public registry of 100,000+ images. When our deploy guides say `image: plausible/analytics:latest`, they're pulling from here.

## Concept 2: Containers

A **container** is a running instance of an image. Image = blueprint. Container = the actual building.

```bash
# Start a container from an image
docker run -d --name my-plausible plausible/analytics:latest

# See running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop my-plausible

# Remove a container (data in volumes is safe)
docker rm my-plausible
```

> 💡 **Why?** Containers are isolated from each other and from your host system. Breaking one container doesn't break anything else.

## Concept 3: Volumes

**Volumes** store your data *outside* the container. This is critical because containers are disposable — when you update an image, you destroy the old container and create a new one. Volumes survive this process.

```bash
# Mount a volume called "plausible-data"
docker run -v plausible-data:/var/lib/clickhouse plausible/analytics
```

Without volumes, your data dies when the container dies. **Always use volumes.**

```bash
# List all volumes
docker volume ls

# Backup a volume (copy to local tar)
docker run --rm -v plausible-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/plausible-backup.tar.gz /data
```

## Concept 4: Docker Compose

This is the big one. **Docker Compose** lets you define multi-container setups in a single YAML file. Most real-world tools need multiple containers (app + database + cache), and Docker Compose handles that.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: plausible/analytics:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: supersecret

volumes:
  db_data:
```

Then run it:

```bash
# Start everything
docker compose up -d

# See logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Update to latest images
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

That's the pattern for **every single deploy guide** in these docs:
1. Copy the `docker-compose.yml`
2. Tweak the environment variables
3. Run `docker compose up -d`
4. Done.

## The 5 Commands You'll Actually Use

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docker compose up -d` | Start all services in the background |
| `docker compose down` | Stop all services |
| `docker compose logs -f` | Watch live logs (Ctrl+C to exit) |
| `docker compose pull` | Download latest images |
| `docker ps` | List running containers |

That's it. That's Docker for self-hosters.
