# Concepts

Before you deploy anything, understand the building blocks. These guides cover the **why** and **how** behind self-hosting infrastructure — no fluff, no PhD required.

> 📖 **Reading order matters.** Start from the top and work down. Each article builds on the one before it.

| 3 | [Reverse Proxies Explained](/concepts/reverse-proxies) | Map `app.yourdomain.com` to your containers with Caddy |
| 4 | [SSL/TLS for Self-Hosters](/concepts/ssl-tls) | HTTPS, Let's Encrypt, and why it matters |
