# What is Self-Hosting?

**In one sentence:** Self-hosting means running software on a server *you* control, instead of paying someone else to run it for you.

That's it. That's the whole concept.

When you use Gmail, Google runs the email server. When you use Notion, Notion Inc runs the database. When you self-host, **you** run these things — on a cheap VPS, a spare laptop, or even a Raspberry Pi.

## Why Would You Do This?

| Reason | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **💰 Cost** | Most open source tools are free. A $5/mo server can replace $200+/mo in SaaS subscriptions. |
| **🔒 Privacy** | Your data lives on your server. No one mines it, sells it, or trains AI on it. |
| **🎛️ Control** | No surprise feature removals. No price hikes. No "we're sunsetting this product" emails. |
| **🧠 Learning** | You'll actually understand how software works. This makes you a better developer, designer, or founder. |

## What You Actually Need

Here's the brutal truth: **self-hosting requires effort**. Not *genius-level* effort, but *following-a-recipe* effort.

You need three things:

1. **A server** — A $4–6/mo VPS from Hetzner, [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/2ed27757a361), or similar. [We compare them →](/quick-start/choosing-a-server)
2. **Docker** — The tool that packages software into neat, runnable containers. [Docker basics →](/concepts/docker-basics)
3. **20 minutes of patience** — Most tools deploy in under 20 minutes if you follow our guides.

> 🔥 **Pro Tip:** You don't need to know Linux commands by heart. You need to know how to copy-paste. Seriously.

## The Self-Hosting Spectrum

Not all self-hosting is equal. Here's where most people land:

```
Easy ─────────────────────────────────────── Hard

Docker run     Docker Compose     Kubernetes
(1 command)    (1 YAML file)      (for masochists)
```

**Good news:** 95% of the tools in our directory work with Docker Compose — a single file that describes your entire setup. Our guides always give you that file, ready to go.

## Common Fears (Debunked)

**"I'll get hacked"** → You're more likely to get breached through a SaaS provider's data leak than through a properly configured VPS with a firewall and SSH keys.

**"I can't handle maintenance"** → Docker makes updates a two-command affair: `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`. That's it.

**"What if it breaks at 3 AM?"** → Set up [Uptime Kuma](/deploy/uptime-kuma) (takes 5 minutes) and you'll know before your users do.

**"I don't have time"** → You don't have time to submit GDPR data requests to 47 SaaS vendors either. Pick your battles.
