## What You'll Get

A fully working GPT4All instance running on your server. Your data stays on your hardware — no third-party access, no usage limits, no surprise invoices.

## Prerequisites

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose installed ([setup guide](/quick-start/choosing-a-server))
- A domain name pointed to your server (optional but recommended)
- Basic terminal access (SSH)

## The Config

Create a directory for GPT4All and add this `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🚀 Created and distributed by The AltStack
# 🌍 https://thealtstack.com
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Docker Compose for GPT4All
version: '3.8'

services:
  gpt4all:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: gpt4all-server
    ports:
      - "4891:4891"
    volumes:
      - gpt4all_models:/app/models
    networks:
      - gpt4all_net
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:4891/v1/models" ] # GPT4All local API endpoint
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  gpt4all_net:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  gpt4all_models:
    name: gpt4all_models
```

## Let's Ship It

```bash
# Create a directory
mkdir -p /opt/gpt4all && cd /opt/gpt4all

# Create the docker-compose.yml (paste the config above)
nano docker-compose.yml

# Pull images and start
docker compose up -d

# Watch the logs
docker compose logs -f
```



## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Service is accessible on the configured port
- [ ] Admin account created (if applicable)
- [ ] Reverse proxy configured ([Caddy guide](/concepts/reverse-proxies))
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS working
- [ ] Backup script set up ([backup guide](/concepts/backups))
- [ ] Uptime monitor added ([Uptime Kuma](/deploy/uptime-kuma))

## The "I Broke It" Section

**Container won't start?**
```bash
docker compose logs gpt4all | tail -50
```

**Port already in use?**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER
```

**Need to start fresh?**
```bash
docker compose down -v  # ⚠️ This deletes volumes/data!
docker compose up -d
```
