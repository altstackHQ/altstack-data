## What You'll Get

A fully working Qwen 2.5 instance running on your server. Your data stays on your hardware — no third-party access, no usage limits, no surprise invoices.

## Prerequisites

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose installed ([setup guide](/quick-start/choosing-a-server))
- A domain name pointed to your server (optional but recommended)
- Basic terminal access (SSH)

## The Config

Create a directory for Qwen 2.5 and add this `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🚀 Created and distributed by The AltStack
# 🌍 https://thealtstack.com
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

version: '3.8'

services:
  ollama-qwen:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    container_name: ollama-qwen
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "11438:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama_qwen:/root/.ollama

volumes:
  ollama_qwen:
```

## Let's Ship It

```bash
# Create a directory
mkdir -p /opt/qwen && cd /opt/qwen

# Create the docker-compose.yml (paste the config above)
nano docker-compose.yml

# Pull images and start
docker compose up -d

# Watch the logs
docker compose logs -f
```



## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Service is accessible on the configured port
- [ ] Admin account created (if applicable)
- [ ] Reverse proxy configured ([Caddy guide](/concepts/reverse-proxies))
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS working
- [ ] Backup script set up ([backup guide](/concepts/backups))
- [ ] Uptime monitor added ([Uptime Kuma](/deploy/uptime-kuma))

## The "I Broke It" Section

**Container won't start?**
```bash
docker compose logs qwen | tail -50
```

**Port already in use?**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER
```

**Need to start fresh?**
```bash
docker compose down -v  # ⚠️ This deletes volumes/data!
docker compose up -d
```
