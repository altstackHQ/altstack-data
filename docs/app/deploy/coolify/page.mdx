# Deploy Coolify

An open-source, self-hostable PaaS alternative to Vercel, Heroku & Netlify that lets you easily deploy static sites, databases, full-stack applications and 280+ one-click services on your own servers.

A fully operational Coolify instance. Think of Coolify as a self-hosted Vercel or Heroku. Once installed, it manages your other Docker containers, handles deployments from GitHub/GitLab, and provides an integrated reverse proxy.

> 🚀 **Self-Hosting Level:** If you only deploy one thing, let it be Coolify. It makes deploying everything else 10x easier.

## Prerequisites

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose installed ([setup guide](/quick-start/choosing-a-server))
- A domain name pointed to your server (optional but recommended)
- Basic terminal access (SSH)

## The Config

Create a directory for Coolify and add this `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Docker Compose for Coolify
# Note: Coolify is a self-hosted PaaS.
version: '3.8'

services:
  coolify:
    image: ghcr.io/coollabsio/coolify:latest
    container_name: coolify
    ports:

## Let's Ship It

```bash
# Create a directory
mkdir -p /opt/coolify && cd /opt/coolify

# Create the docker-compose.yml (paste the config above)
nano docker-compose.yml

# Pull images and start
docker compose up -d

# Watch the logs
docker compose logs -f
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | `production` | No |
| `DB_CONNECTION` | `pgsql` | No |
| `DB_HOST` | `db` | No |
| `DB_DATABASE` | `coolify` | No |
| `DB_USERNAME` | `coolify` | No |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `${DB_PASSWORD:-password}` | No |


## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Service is accessible on the configured port
- [ ] Admin account created (if applicable)
- [ ] Reverse proxy configured ([Caddy guide](/concepts/reverse-proxies))
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS working
- [ ] Backup script set up ([backup guide](/concepts/backups))
- [ ] Uptime monitor added ([Uptime Kuma](/deploy/uptime-kuma))

## The "I Broke It" Section

**Container won't start?**
```bash
docker compose logs coolify | tail -50
```

**Port already in use?**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER
```

**Need to start fresh?**
```bash
docker compose down -v  # ⚠️ This deletes volumes/data!
docker compose up -d
```
