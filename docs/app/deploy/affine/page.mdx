## What You'll Get

A fully working AFFiNE instance running on your server. Your data stays on your hardware — no third-party access, no usage limits, no surprise invoices.

## Prerequisites

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose installed ([setup guide](/quick-start/choosing-a-server))
- A domain name pointed to your server (optional but recommended)
- Basic terminal access (SSH)

## The Config

Create a directory for AFFiNE and add this `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml

# Docker Compose for AFFiNE
version: '3.8'

services:
  affine:
    image: ghcr.io/toeverything/affine-graphql:latest # Using official as fallback but custom build setup exists in Dockerfile
    container_name: affine
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://affine:affine@db:5432/affine

## Let's Ship It

```bash
# Create a directory
mkdir -p /opt/affine && cd /opt/affine

# Create the docker-compose.yml (paste the config above)
nano docker-compose.yml

# Pull images and start
docker compose up -d

# Watch the logs
docker compose logs -f
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://affine:affine@db:5432/affine` | No |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://redis:6379` | No |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | No |


## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Service is accessible on the configured port
- [ ] Admin account created (if applicable)
- [ ] Reverse proxy configured ([Caddy guide](/concepts/reverse-proxies))
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS working
- [ ] Backup script set up ([backup guide](/concepts/backups))
- [ ] Uptime monitor added ([Uptime Kuma](/deploy/uptime-kuma))

## The "I Broke It" Section

**Container won't start?**
```bash
docker compose logs affine | tail -50
```

**Port already in use?**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER
```

**Need to start fresh?**
```bash
docker compose down -v  # ⚠️ This deletes volumes/data!
docker compose up -d
```
