# 🔒 The Privacy Stack

**Zero data leaks.** Every tool runs on your infrastructure. Your data never touches a third-party server. For teams and individuals who take privacy seriously.

| What | Tool | Replaces |
|---|---|---|
| Password Manager | [Bitwarden](/deploy/bitwarden) | 1Password ($3/mo) |
| Team Chat | [Mattermost](/deploy/mattermost) | Slack ($7/mo) |
| Video Calls | [Jitsi Meet](/deploy/jitsi-meet) | Zoom ($14/mo) |
| Analytics | [Matomo](/deploy/matomo) | Google Analytics (free, sells your data) |
| Notes & Docs | [AppFlowy](/deploy/appflowy) | Notion ($10/mo) |
| Knowledge Base | [Affine](/deploy/affine) | Confluence ($6/mo) |

**Total saved: ~$185/mo**

## Why Privacy Matters

It's not about having "something to hide." It's about:

- **Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 — self-hosting makes audits simpler
- **IP Protection**: Your internal docs and conversations stay *internal*
- **Trust**: Your users' data is on your servers, not in someone else's quarterly report
- **Sovereignty**: No foreign government can compel access to your data on a third-party server

## The Privacy Audit

For each tool in this stack, we verify:

- ✅ **No telemetry** (or can be disabled)
- ✅ **No external API calls** after deployment
- ✅ **Data stored locally** in your Postgres / filesystem
- ✅ **End-to-end encryption** available where applicable
- ✅ **Self-contained** — works offline
