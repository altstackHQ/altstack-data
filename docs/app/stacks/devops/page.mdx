# ⚙️ The DevOps Stack

**Self-host everything.** From backend to hosting to monitoring — deploy and manage your entire infrastructure on your own terms.

| What | Tool | Replaces |
|---|---|---|
| Backend as a Service | [Supabase](/deploy/supabase) | Firebase ($25+/mo) |
| PaaS (Deployment) | [Coolify](/deploy/coolify) | Vercel Pro ($20/mo) |
| Git Deployment | [Dokku](/deploy/dokku) | Heroku ($25/mo) |
| Web Analytics | [Plausible](/deploy/plausible) | Google Analytics (free, but your data) |
| Product Analytics | [PostHog](/deploy/posthog) | Amplitude ($49/mo) |

**Total saved: ~$375/mo**

## The Philosophy

The DevOps Stack is for teams that refuse to be dependent on any single vendor. Every tool here:

- **Runs on standard Docker** — migrate anywhere in minutes
- **Uses Postgres** — your data is in an open format
- **Has an active community** — you're never truly on your own
- **Scales horizontally** — grows with you without pricing tiers

## Server Requirements

This is the most resource-intensive stack. You need a proper server:

| Spec | Recommended |
|---|---|
| RAM | 8 GB minimum (16 GB ideal) |
| CPU | 4 vCPU |
| Storage | 80 GB SSD |
| Cost | ~$15/mo (Hetzner CX32) |
