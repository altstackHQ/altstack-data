# 🚀 The Bootstrapper Stack

**Launch for $0/mo.** Everything you need to build, ship, and manage a SaaS product without spending a dime on software.

| What | Tool | Monthly SaaS Cost Replaced |
|---|---|---|
| Database & Auth | [Supabase](/deploy/supabase) | ~$25/mo (Firebase) |
| Project Management | [Plane](/deploy/plane) | ~$10/mo (Jira) |
| Team Chat | [Rocket.Chat](/deploy/rocketchat) | ~$7/mo (Slack) |
| Deployment PaaS | [Coolify](/deploy/coolify) | ~$20/mo (Vercel Pro) |
| Web Analytics | [Plausible](/deploy/plausible) | ~$9/mo (Plausible Cloud) |
| UI/UX Design | [Penpot](/deploy/penpot) | ~$15/mo (Figma) |

**Total saved: ~$310/mo** · **Your cost: ~$6/mo (one VPS)**

## Deploy Order

Deploy in this order — each tool builds on the previous:

### 1. Coolify (your PaaS)
Coolify turns your VPS into a self-hosted Vercel. Once it's running, you can deploy everything else *through it*.

→ [Deploy Coolify](/deploy/coolify)

### 2. Supabase (your backend)
Database, authentication, storage, and realtime — all in one. This is your app's backbone.

→ [Deploy Supabase](/deploy/supabase)

### 3. Plausible (your analytics)
Drop Google Analytics. Plausible is lightweight, cookie-free, and respects your users' privacy.

→ [Deploy Plausible](/deploy/plausible)

### 4. Plane (your project board)
Jira without the Jira experience. Clean, fast, issue tracking that doesn't make you want to quit.

→ [Deploy Plane](/deploy/plane)

### 5. Rocket.Chat (your team chat)
Slack without the $7/user/mo. Self-hosted, full-featured, and it doesn't sell your conversations.

→ [Deploy Rocket.Chat](/deploy/rocketchat)

### 6. Penpot (your design tool)
open source Figma alternative. Real-time collaboration, SVG-based, and free forever.

→ [Deploy Penpot](/deploy/penpot)

## Server Requirements

| Spec | Recommended |

| RAM | 4 GB minimum (8 GB ideal) |
| CPU | 2 vCPU |
