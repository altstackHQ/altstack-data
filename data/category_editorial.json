            "E-commerce platforms are the foundation of online retail. Shopify has made launching a store remarkably simple, but that simplicity comes with trade-offs: transaction fees on every sale, limited customization depth, and a dependency on Shopify's infrastructure for your entire business. When the platform decides to change its API, adjust its pricing, or deprecate a feature you rely on, you adapt or you scramble.",
            "The headless commerce movement has shifted the conversation from 'which all-in-one platform' to 'which best-of-breed components.' By decoupling the storefront from the commerce engine, teams can use any frontend framework while plugging into a commerce backend for product management, orders, payments, and fulfillment. Open-source headless platforms like Medusa.js make this architecture accessible without enterprise licensing fees.",
            "For brands that have outgrown template-based storefronts or need multi-market support, self-hosted commerce infrastructure offers the flexibility to build exactly the shopping experience their customers expect, without the constraints and costs of managed platforms."
